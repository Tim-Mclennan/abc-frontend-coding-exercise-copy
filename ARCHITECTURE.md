# Architecture

This file can be used to detail:

* Architecture decisions.
* Future implementation details that cannot (or should not!) be attempted in the alotted time.

## Accessibility:
- Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard. This includes implementing proper tab order and focus management, especially for the auto-complete functionality. Documenting a strategy for handling focus, especially after selecting an item from the results list, would enhance usability for keyboard users.

- ARIA Attributes: While some ARIA attributes are already in use (e.g., aria-label, aria-haspopup, aria-controls), ensuring that dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers is crucial. For instance, when the results list is populated or updated, use aria-live regions to announce updates.

## Maintainability:
- Component Decomposition: Break down UI components into smaller, reusable components where possible. This not only makes the code easier to manage but also enhances readability and maintainability.

- CSS Methodology: Adopt a CSS methodology like BEM (Block Element Modifier) for consistent naming conventions. This helps in avoiding CSS conflicts and makes the stylesheets more readable and maintainable.


## Scalability:
- State Management: For larger applications, consider using a state management library like Redux or Context API for React. This helps in managing global state more efficiently and makes the state accessible across components.

- API Caching: Document strategies for caching API responses to reduce redundant network requests. This not only improves the efficiency of the application but also reduces the load on the server.

## Efficiency:
1. Debouncing API Calls: Implement debouncing for the auto-complete feature to limit API calls while the user is typing. This improves the application's efficiency and reduces unnecessary load on the server.
2. Optimize Assets: Ensure that images, fonts, and other assets are optimized for the web. This includes using modern image formats like WebP and compressing assets without significant loss of quality.
